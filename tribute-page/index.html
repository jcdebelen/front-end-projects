            <div>
                <h4>The very first song I ever wrote</h4>
                <p>The very first song I ever wrote would have to be this song called “The Junction,” inspired by Michael Jackson. Kind of R&B. Disco. Falsetto. I only got as far as the chorus. I got myself a Walkman and I bought myself the cassette of Off The Wall, and then I started sound-tripping and suddenly, after I put down the Walkman, a tune started playing in my head.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="right">
                <h4>There was a time when writing in Tagalog</h4>
                <p>There was a time when writing in Tagalog was more of a conscious decision. The songs that we started writing in the beginning were all in English. Blues-based stuff like “Waiting for the Bus,” “Scorpio Rising.” But “Ligaya” and “Pare Ko,” came from a natural place kasi probinsyano ako and everything I would hear in Bicol was all OPM, and I’m also comfortable with that kind of music. But lyric-wise, I could not write anything poetic in English so it was all kantospeak.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>When I started writing for the Eheads</h4>
                <p>When I started writing for the Eheads, I wrote for the band. I was looking for a sound everybody would be comfortable with. At that time, it came naturally. We played with the blues. We were into classic rock, Elvis, Beatles. David Bowie, we were into that.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="right">
                <h4>The feeling of rejection isn’t nice</h4>
                <p>The feeling of rejection isn’t nice. But I guess that’s where my naïveté served me. At that time, you had nothing to lose, and you believed in yourself and you believed that there has to be someone who’ll like you and that kept me going.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>What would I consider the top five songs</h4>
                <p>What would I consider the top five songs I’ve written? Number one would be “Poorman’s Grave.” Then “TNT,” “Alapaap,” “Magasin,” “Disconnection Notice.”</p>
            </div>
            <div class="right">
                <h4>The greatest lesson from my mom</h4>
                <p>The greatest lesson from my mom is love conquers all. I think that would be it. She didn’t say it. She just showed me.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>With the Eheads it was always the melody.</h4>
            <p>With the Eheads it was always the melody. Sometimes—like with “El Bimbo” and “Wag Mo Nang Itanong” and “Magasin”—lyrics came out at the same time as the melody. Mostly the intro and then I started mixing things up just to keep it fresh. I tried other methodologies. Some I got from Raimund and Buddy and Marcus who always wrote differently, who mostly started from lyrics. Sometimes I couldn’t understand how to do that. Just not the way I did things.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="right">
                <h4>Why were the Eraserheads successful?</h4>
                <p>The clashing styles of the band members made up a kind of Frankenstein’s monster that somehow worked.</p>
