                <h1>WHAT IS BOOST?</h1>
                <p>It's hard to imagine adidas without Boostâ€”the revolutionary performance shoe technology that first hit the pavement in 2013. Boost was unlike anything that came before, and its energy return technology would go on to change the course of running forever. Today, adidas continues to iterate Boost and push the concept even further ahead.</p>
                <p>adidas Boost technology is a product of the adidas Innovation Team (AIT) and German chemists BASF. It was created to bring together the formerly contradictory benefits of soft and responsive cushioning. At the time, EVA foam was the industry standard for performance running shoes. Boost was about to change all that, introducing a midsole made from thousands of expanded particles that work together to deliver an uptick of energy return in every stride.</p>
                <h1>THE EVOLUTION OF BOOST</h1>
                <p>From its first commercial release in 2013, Boost has set new standards for performance shoe technology and constantly pushed that narrative forward with iteration and improvement. Hereâ€™s a quick timeline of some of the major achievements of Boost.
