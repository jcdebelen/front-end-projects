                <h2>WHAT ARE THE FEATURES OF BOOST?</h2>
                <p>Boost has always been known for its energy return, but there are actually five Boost benefits that elevate the running experience. Let's start with comfort: the cushioning properties of Boost make it feel like youâ€™re running on tiny, precision-engineered clouds. Boost is also designed to cope with a wide range of temperatures, making it the kind of running shoe that can pound through wind, snow, sun, rainâ€”whateverâ€”with no issues.
                    <br><br>The third and fourth benefits of Boost are durability and flexibility. Boost is a technology that can hold up for mile after mile without any loss of performance. At the same time, Boost is flexible enough to provide a silky smooth rideâ€”no matter what pace youâ€™re setting.
                    <br><br> But we can't talk about Boost without talking about energy returnâ€”the fifth and most famous benefit of Boost. The power to absorb and return more of an athleteâ€™s kinetic output is what changed the performance shoe industry forever. There have been many imitators, but Boost remains the icon of energy return.</p>

                <h2>HOW IS BOOST MADE?</h2>
                <p>To create Boost, thermoplastic polyurethane particles are expanded to form closed cells around tiny pockets of air. The resulting product is known as expanded thermoplastic polyurethane â€” or eTPU, for short.</p>
