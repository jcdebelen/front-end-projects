                <h1>WHAT IS BOOST?</h1>
                <p>It's hard to imagine adidas without Boostâ€”the revolutionary performance shoe technology that first hit the pavement in 2013. Boost was unlike anything that came before, and its energy return technology would go on to change the course of running forever. Today, adidas continues to iterate Boost and push the concept even further ahead.</p>
                <p>adidas Boost technology is a product of the adidas Innovation Team (AIT) and German chemists BASF. It was created to bring together the formerly contradictory benefits of soft and responsive cushioning. At the time, EVA foam was the industry standard for performance running shoes. Boost was about to change all that, introducing a midsole made from thousands of expanded particles that work together to deliver an uptick of energy return in every stride.</p>
                <h1>WHAT ARE THE FEATURES OF BOOST?</h1>
                <p>Boost has always been known for its energy return, but there are actually five Boost benefits that elevate the running experience. Let's start with comfort: the cushioning properties of Boost make it feel like youâ€™re running on tiny, precision-engineered clouds. Boost is also designed to cope with a wide range of temperatures, making it the kind of running shoe that can pound through wind, snow, sun, rainâ€”whateverâ€”with no issues.
                    <br><br>The third and fourth benefits of Boost are durability and flexibility. Boost is a technology that can hold up for mile after mile without any loss of performance. At the same time, Boost is flexible enough to provide a silky smooth rideâ€”no matter what pace youâ€™re setting.
                    <br><br> But we can't talk about Boost without talking about energy returnâ€”the fifth and most famous benefit of Boost. The power to absorb and return more of an athleteâ€™s kinetic output is what changed the performance shoe industry forever. There have been many imitators, but Boost remains the icon of energy return.</p>

                <h1>HOW IS BOOST MADE?</h1>
                <p>To create Boost, thermoplastic polyurethane particles are expanded to form closed cells around tiny pockets of air. The resulting product is known as expanded thermoplastic polyurethane â€” or eTPU, for short.</p>
